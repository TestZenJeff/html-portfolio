<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Self-taught front- and back-end developer with the ability to build projects from the bottom up. I can design, code, and deploy in an orderly and effective manner because I am proficient in all the major languages.

</p>I've had a lot of opportunity as a Technical Support Engineer to hone my soft skills, such organization, communication, and adaptability, and I think these will be very useful to both my business and me down the road.
